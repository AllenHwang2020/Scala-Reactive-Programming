# Scala Reactive Programming
This is the code repository for [Scala Reactive Programming](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/scala-reactive-programming?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787288645), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Reactive programming is a scalable, fast way to build applications, and one that helps us write code that is concise, clear, and readable. It can be used for many purposes such as GUIs, robotics, music, and others, and is central to many concurrent systems. This book will be your guide to getting started with Reactive programming in Scala.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

All code files have been placed in their repsective folders. Chapter01 do not have any code file.

The code will look like the following:
```
object HelloWorldApp extends App{
println("Hello Scala World!")
}
```

* Readers are expected to have some knowledge of Scala, SBT, and the IntelliJ
IDEA or any IDE usage. Familiarity with at least one web application
development framework will make learning another web framework easy.
* Readers should have Java 8, SBT, IntelliJ IDEA, and Scala in their local systems.
